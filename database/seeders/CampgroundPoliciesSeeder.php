This is why many of the electric pedestals at the sites have both a larger plug for your camper and a standard plug for tenting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This setup is designed for one plug or the other to be in use, but not both at the same time. Using both can potentially strain our electrical systems and may lead to your ejection from the park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using both plugs at the same time is strictly prohibited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plugging any trailer designed for 50 amp use into a 30 amp electric site is discouraged. Most 50 amp to 30 amp plug converters DO NOT limit your trailer from trying to use 50 amps and will blow our circuit breakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failure to pay your electric bill may result in electricity being turned off to your site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EJECTION FROM THE PARK:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kayuta Lake Campground reserves the right to revoke or suspend your camping privileges, where you would be no longer a registered guest should you and/or your children and/or your visitors fail to comply with any of the Campground Rules and/or the Policies, Terms, and Conditions. By utilizing the campground and its services you hereby consent to the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campers ejected from the park will no longer be registered guests and will be considered trespassing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event that Camper shall vacate the Site, voluntarily or involuntarily, for any reason whatsoever, Camper shall return the Site to Campground in the same condition as received on the date of occupancy, ordinary wear and tear accepted.

Such conduct shall include, but not be limited to the following: (1) use of a firearm(s); (2) violent or abusive conduct and/or language; (3) public drunkenness; (4) possession of narcotics or other illegal substances; (5) breaking the law; (6) breaking campground Guidelines, Campground Rules and/or the Campground Policies, Terms, and Conditions; (7) disturbing other&rsquo;s enjoyment of the campground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be no refunds in the event of an ejection or revocation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>END OF SEASON:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All utilities must be disconnected at the end of each season.
