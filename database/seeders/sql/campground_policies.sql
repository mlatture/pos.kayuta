<p>NEATNESS POLICY:</p>

<p>Seasonals are responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of their site including, but not limited to, mowing, trimming, weed removal, maintenance of decks, sheds, and all other camping equipment. We ask that you mow at least every two weeks. In the event Management determines it is necessary to mow a lawn or clean a site, a fee of $100.00 will be charged and billed to the Camper. This fee shall be due immediately. All tarps must be removed from your camper and your site set up prior to Memorial Day weekend. The area beneath your camper must be kept clear of all debris.</p>

<p>All firewood must be stacked neatly.</p>

<p>Debris, junk, trash, and other unsightly items may not be stored at your site.</p>

<p>NEW TRAILER PURCHASES:</p>

<p>PRIOR to purchasing a new camping unit, Camper agrees to provide Management with the dimensions and age of the proposed new camping unit so Campground can confirm whether the camping unit is compliant with Campground policy as well as fit comfortably on the Site along with your vehicles and the Camper&rsquo;s other camping items.</p>

<p>All camping units must be self-contained. No unauthorized park models or mobile homes. No units over 10 years old are permitted in the park, without permission from Management. While it is not our intent to force the replacement of trailers, we do require that all newly purchased seasonal trailers be newer than 10 years old and meet our current guidelines, which include functional gray &amp; black water holding tanks and RV-style toilets.</p>

<p>If the new camping unit does not fit on the Site, Management reserves the right to change Camper&rsquo;s Site to a different one so long as there is a site on the Campground that is available and adequate in size. The campground is not obligated to provide the Camper with a site that will fit the new camping unit.</p>

<p>Please check with Management before purchasing a Park Model. Certain style units are NOT authorized for use in the Campground. Your RV must be a roadworthy, fully self-contained pop-up, travel trailer, 5th wheel, motor home or a park model with the ability to function independently and comply with the following minimum criteria:</p>

<p>UNIT MUST BE EQUIPPED WITH: 1) LP gas system - maximum 2 tanks @ 30# each, 2) gray &amp; black water holding tanks, 3) permanent front-end hitch attached, 4) roof cannot be pitched, cathedral or shingled, 5) wheels need to stay on and must be capable of being transported.
